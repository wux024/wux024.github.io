I work at [Intelligent Perception and Optoelectronic Information Processing Group](https://lab.rjmart.cn/10507/ipoeip) as a Ph.D. in Changchun. I graduated from [School of Physics](http://www.phy.nenu.edu.cn/), [Northeast Normal University](https://www.nenu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree in 2019 and a master's degree in 2022, advised by Prof. [Lianming Wang](https://hxy.hntou.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs/gjzc/202310/t20231023_80854.html). I am currently studying for a Ph.D. in School of Physics, Northeast Normal University, advised by Prof. [Huang Jipeng](http://js.nenu.edu.cn/teacher/index.php?zgh=2012900387). My research interests are in optoelectronic information processing and intelligent perception, and I am recently working on animal pose estimation.
